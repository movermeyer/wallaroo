# Alphabet

## About The Application

This is an example application that takes "votes" for different letters of the alphabet and keeps a running total of the votes received for each letter. For each incoming message, it sends out a message with the total votes for that letter. The total number of votes for each letter are stored together in a single state object.

### Input

The inputs to the "Alphabet" application are the letter receiving the vote followed by a 32-bit integer representing the number of votes for this message, with the whole thing encoded in the [source message framing protocol](/book/core-concepts/decoders-and-encoders.md#framed-message-protocols#source-message-framing-protocol). Here's an example input message, written as a Python string:

```
"\x00\x00\x00\x05A\x00\x00\x15\x34"
```

`\x00\x00\x00\x05` -- four bytes representing the number of bytes in the payload
`A` -- a single byte representing the letter "A", which is receiving the votes
`\x00\x00\x15\x34` -- the number `0x1534` (`5428`) represented as a big-endiant 32-bit integer

### Output

The outputs of the alphabet application are the letter that received the votes that triggered this message, followed by a 64-bit integer representing the total number of votes for this letter, with the whole thing encoded in the [source message framing protocol](/book/core-concepts/decoders-and-encoders.md#framed-message-protocols#source-message-framing-protocol). Here's an example input message, written as a Python string:

```
"\x00\x00\x00\x09q\x00\x00\x5A\x21\x10\xB7\x11\xA4"
```

`\x00\x00\x00\x09` -- four bytes representing the number of bytes in the payload
`q` -- a single byte representing the letter "q", which is receiving the votes
`\x00\x00\x5A\x21\x10\xB7\x11\xA4` -- the number `0x5A2110B711A4` (`99098060853668`) represented as a big-endiant 64-bit integer

### Processing

The `Decoder`'s `decode(...)` method creates a `Votes` object with the letter being voted on and the number of votes it is receiving with this message. The `Votes` object is passed with the `AddVotes` computation to the state object that stores all of the vote totals, and the `compute(...)` function modifies the state to record the new total number of votes for the letter. It then creates an `AllVotes` message, which is sent to `Encode`'s `encode(...)` method, which converts it into an outgoing message.

## Running Alphabet

In order to run the application you will need Machida, Giles Sender, and the Cluster Shutdown tool. To build them, please see the [Linux](/book/getting-started/linux-setup.md) or [Mac OS](/book/getting-started/macos-setup.md) setup instructions. Alternatively, they could be run in Docker, please see the [Docker](/book/getting-started/docker-setup.md) setup instructions.

Note: If running in Docker, the relative paths are not necessary for binaries as they are all bound to the PATH within the container. You will not need to set the `PATH` variable and you'd only need to append the current directory to `PYTHONPATH`.

You will need three separate shells to run this application. Open each shell and go to the `examples/python/alphabet` directory.


### Shell 1

Run `nc` to listen for TCP output on `127.0.0.1` port `7002`:

```bash
nc -l 127.0.0.1 7002 > alphabet.out
```

### Shell 2

Set `PYTHONPATH` to refer to the current directory (where `alphabet.py` is) and the `machida` directory (where `wallaroo.py` is). Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `machida` executable. Assuming you installed Machida according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:.:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida"
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build"
```

Run `machida` with `--application-module alphabet`:

```bash
machida --application-module alphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 \
  --out 127.0.0.1:7002 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 \
  --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --cluster-initializer --data 127.0.0.1:6001 \
  --name worker-name --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock
```

### Shell 3

Send messages:

```bash
../../../giles/sender/sender --host 127.0.0.1:7010 --file votes.msg \
  --batch-size 50 --interval 10_000_000 --messages 1000000 --binary \
  --msg-size 9 --repeat --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock --no-write
```
## Reading the Output

You can read the output with the following code:

```python
import struct

num_bytes = 4 + 1 + 8
with open('alphabet.out', 'rb') as f:
    while True:
        try:
            print struct.unpack('>IsQ', f.read(num_bytes))
        except:
            break
```

## Shutdown

You can shut down the Wallaroo cluster with this command once processing has finished:

```bash
../../../utils/cluster_shutdown/cluster_shutdown 127.0.0.1:5050
```

You can shut down Giles Sender by pressing `Ctrl-c` from its shell.
